1.  **Custom Functions:**
    *   You can extend the agent's capabilities by defining and registering custom functions or tools that the agent's language model can call. This allows the agent to perform actions beyond the built-in browser operations. The `controller` parameter in the `Agent` class is used to register these custom functions.

2.  **Lifecycle Hooks:**
    *   Browser-Use provides lifecycle hooks that let you run custom code at specific points during the agent's execution.
    *   The available hooks are `on_step_start` (executed at the beginning of each agent step) and `on_step_end` (executed at the end of each step).
    *   Hooks are callable functions passed as parameters to the `agent.run()` method.
    *   Inside a hook, you have access to the `Agent` instance and its state, allowing you to monitor history (URLs, actions, thoughts, extracted content), access the browser context (get HTML, take screenshots), or even pause/resume the agent.
    *   Examples show how to use hooks to record agent activity, including visited URLs, model thoughts and actions, and even capture HTML and screenshots.

3.  **Agent Settings:**
    *   The `Agent` class is the main component and offers various configuration options upon initialization.
    *   **Required Parameters:** `task` (the instruction for the agent) and `llm` (a LangChain chat model instance).
    *   **Behavior Parameters:**
        *   `controller`: Used to register custom functions (as mentioned above).
        *   `use_vision`: Enables/disables vision capabilities for the LLM (default is True). Disabling can reduce costs if the model supports it.
        *   `save_conversation_path`: Saves the full conversation history.
        *   `override_system_message` or `extend_system_message`: Customize the agent's system prompt.
    *   **(Reuse) Browser Configuration:**
        *   You can pass an existing Browser Use `Browser` instance (`browser` parameter) or a Playwright `BrowserContext` (`browser_context` parameter) to reuse browser sessions across multiple agent runs, maintaining persistent sessions.
    *   **Running the Agent:**
        *   The agent is executed with the async `run()` method.
        *   `max_steps`: Sets a limit on the number of steps to prevent infinite loops (default 100).
    *   **Agent History:**
        *   The `run()` method returns an `AgentHistoryList` object containing the full execution history, including URLs visited, screenshots, actions, extracted content, errors, and model thoughts. This is useful for debugging and analysis.
        *   `initial_actions`: You can provide a list of actions to be executed before the LLM takes over.
        *   `message_context`: Provides additional information to the LLM about the task.
        *   `planner_llm`: Allows using a separate (potentially smaller/cheaper) model for high-level task planning. Parameters like `use_vision_for_planner` and `planner_interval` control its behavior.
    *   **Optional Parameters:** Include `max_actions_per_step`, `max_failures`, `retry_delay`, and `generate_gif`.
    *   **Memory Management:**
        *   The agent has a procedural memory system (enabled by default with `enable_memory=True`) that summarizes conversation history at intervals (`memory_interval`) to manage context window usage for long tasks.

In summary, Browser-Use offers significant customization through defining custom tools/functions, leveraging lifecycle hooks to interact with the agent's execution flow, and configuring various aspects of the agent's behavior, browser interaction, planning, and memory management through the `Agent` class parameters.
